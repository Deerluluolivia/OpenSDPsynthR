# OpenSDP Data

A project to generate realistic synthetic unit-level longitudinal education data. 

## Get Started

To use `OpenSDP_data`, follow the instructions below:

## Design Goals

1. Generate synthetic education data that is realistic for use by analysts across the education sector. 
 Realistic means messy, and reflective of the general pattern of relationships found in the U.S. education 
 sector. 
2. Synthetic data should be able to be generated on-demand and responsive to inputs from the user. These 
 inputs should allow the user to configure the process to produce data that resembles the patterns of data 
 in their agency. 
3. The package should be modular and extendable allowing new data topics to be generated as needed so synthetic 
 data coverage can grow. 

## Package Dependencies

- `dplyr`
- `lubridate`
- [wakefield](https://www.github.com/trinker/wakefield)
